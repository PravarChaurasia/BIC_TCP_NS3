# BIC_TCP_NS3
BIC comparison on Linux and ns3, modificaiton to overlap the graph in both Linux Kernel and ns3-dce

1) As Ns-3-dce does not have the correct and same  implementation of PRR Recovery as Linux we need to update the ns-3-dev. After updating ns-3-dev we need to build it again. 
2) We updated the ns-3-dev using the link https://gitlab.com/apoorvabhargava/ns-3-dev.git
